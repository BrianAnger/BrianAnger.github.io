        <p>When Nicolle joined Microsoft in March 2010, she sent out an email with interesting tidbits about her.  Brian was on an adjacent team and was one of the people that asked a follow-up question about Nicolle's intro email.  Nicolle went to his office to say "Hello!" and meet him for the first time, not knowing that he would become the love of her life.  From there they were work acquaintances, chatting every now and then.  Every week or so, Brian would bring back cookies after taking one of his (many) long lunches and went around the office to share his cookies with coworkers.  Nicolle was on the "cookie list" and this was one of her favorite visits (she really liked cookies).  They also went to lunch once where Brian was attacked by bees.  Aside from this, Nicolle and Brian didn't really hang out--they were on adjacent teams after all.</p>
        <p>Nicolle was in a long relationship when she met Brian, but when it ended in October 2010, Brian received a Facebook notification and acted without delay.  Brian would've normally waited and gave Nicolle space, but he didn't want to risk the chance that someone would woo her before he had a chance.  The very next Friday, Brian asked Nicolle out; they had their first date on October 23, 2010.  Nicolle was swept off her feet during their first date and has been ever since.  Nicolle and Brian got engaged on July 10, 2014, and have set the wedding date for October 24, 2015, five years and one day from that wonderful first date.</p>

        <p>
          The best airport to fly in to is

The Costa Mesa Marriott provides a free shuttle to and from the SNA airport, upon request (714-957-1100).  If you're feeling adventurous and up for a car ride, you could fly in to
          <a href="http://www.lgb.org/">Long Beach Airport</a> (LGB), which is 25 miles northwest of the hotel, or
          <a href="http://www.lawa.org/welcomeLAX.aspx">Los Angeles International Airport</a> (LAX), which is 45 miles northwest of the hotel.
        </p>

        <h2>By Car</h2>

Head north for a few hundred feet and take a right onto Anton Blvd.  Go straight for about 3/10 of a mile and the Costa Mesa Marriott will be on your left.
